;
; Based on Steph Parker (steph.parker58@yahoo.com.au) script make-anaglyph
;
; Decription is taken from make-anaglyph script and slightly modified
;
; This program creates stereoscopic 3D anaglyph photos from a stereo pair.
; In order to make use of this program you will first need a pair of images
; from slightly different angles or the same object. This script loads
; both images as different layers in the same image window in Gimp with the
; right image as the Bottom layer and the left image as the next layer above
; it. The script finishes leaving the two images as seperate layers so that
; final alignment adjustments can be made before merging the layers down
; and saving the anaglyph.
;
; Any colours can be chosen for the two layers but it is recommended that 
; you only choose colours with individual RGB values of 0 or 255 and that
; the two colours compliment each other. The default colours, and the most
; commoly used colour combination, are Red (255 0 0) for the right image and
; cyan (0 255 255) for the left image. Other possible pairs are:
;       Red   (255 0 0) and Blue    (0 0 255)
;       Red   (255 0 0) and Green   (0 255 0)
;       Blue  (0 0 255) and Green   (0 255 0)
;       Blue  (0 0 255) and Yellow  (255 255 0)
;       Green (0 255 0) and Magenta (255 0 255)
; but be warned, not all colour pairs work equally well.

; To view the anaglyphs as 3D images you will need a pair of glasses in
; the colours that you have chosen with the colour of the left eye of 
; the glasses matching the colour applied to the right image (e.g.
; with the default red/cyan combination the red side of the glasses
; goes over the left eye and the cyan side on the right eye).
